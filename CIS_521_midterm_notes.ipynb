        "2. You can use Markdown formatting for your summaries. \n",
        "3. You can use Latex formatting for equations. Put two dollar signs before and after your equation like this: \n",
        "$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{1}{mc^2} $$\n",

Then it choses the action that leads to the best expected utility, where expected utility is computed by ave possible outcomes, weighted by probability of each outcome. \\\n\nModel-free agent learns what action is the best in a particulat situation without ever learning how that action changes the env. \\\n\nAll agents can improve their performance through learning and any agent (from above) can be built as a learning agent. \\\nLearning elem uses feedback fron the critic and determines how perf. elem should be modified to do better in the future. \\\nGiven a design for perf. elem, learning mechanism can be constructed to improve every part of the agent. \\\n\nIn Atomic Representation, each state of the world is indivisble and has no internal structure. \\\nTwo diff. atomic states have nothing in common - they are just different black boxes. \\\n\nFactored Representation - splits each state into a fixed stated of vars and attributes, each of which can have a value. \\\nTwo diff. factored states can share some attributes, but not the other. It makes it easy to work out how to turn one state into another.\\\n\nStructured Representation in which objects and their relationships can be described explicitely.\n\nDistributed Representation - representation of a concept that is spread over many memory locations.\n\n\n## Module 1 Lecture Notes\n\nRule of thumb for performance measure: It's better to design perf.measures according to what you want to be achieved in the  environment, rather than how you think an agent  should behave. \\\n\nComputational limitations make complete rationality unachievable! \\\n\nTask Environments \\\n\nPEAS for specifying environment: \\\nP - performance measure \\\nE - environment \\\nA - actiators \\\nS - sensors \\\n\nAmazon Delivery Drones Example: \\\nP: max profits, min time, deliver to right location, etc. \\\nE: airspace, obstacles when airborne, safe drop off spots, etc. \\\nA: propellers, flight control system, mechanism to verify delivery, etc. \\\nS: GPS, altitude, gyroscope sensors, etc. \\\n\n\n## Module 1 Definitions\n* **Agent** - anything that perceives its environment through sensors can act on its environment through actuators\n* **Percept** - signal that agent receives through its sensors\n* **Rational agent** - for each possible percept seq. P, rational agent selects action a that maximizes the expected value of its performance measure\n* **Value alignment problem** - your definitions here\n* **Omniscience** - The state of knowing everything\n* **Information gathering** - doing actions in order to modify future perceipts\n* ******** - \n* **Task environment** - a problem specification for which the agent is a solution\n* **Transition model** - Knowledge about how the world works\n* **Sensor model** - knowledge how the state of the world is reflected in the agent's percepts\n* **Learning elem** - responsible for making improvements\n* **Performance elem** - responsible for selecting external action\n* **Critic** - judges how agent is doing with respect to fixed perf. standard\n* **Problem generator** - suggests actions that lead to new and informative experiences\n* **Reward (penalty)** - provides direct feedback on the quality of agent's behavior\n* **Learning (in intelligent agents)** - process of modification of components to bring them closer to goal (based on feedback), agent's performance improvement\n\n\n## Module 1 Figures\n<img src=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/data/smart-textbook/AIMA_figures/figure_2.6.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.6\" width=\"75%\"/>\n\n* **Figure 2.6** - Examples of task env. & their characteristics\n<img src=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/data/smart-textbook/AIMA_figures/figure_2.11.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.11\" width=\"75%\"/>\n\n* **Figure 2.11** - Model-based reflex agent\n<img src=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/data/smart-textbook/AIMA_figures/figure_2.14.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.14\" width=\"75%\"/>\n\n* **Figure 2.14** - Model-based utility-based agent (see explanation in Ch 2.4)\n<img src=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/data/smart-textbook/AIMA_figures/figure_2.15.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.15\" width=\"75%\"/>\n\n* **Figure 2.15** - General learning agent\n<img src=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/data/smart-textbook/AIMA_figures/figure_2.16.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.16\" width=\"75%\"/>\n\n* **Figure 2.16** - Atomic, Factored, Structured states\n"
